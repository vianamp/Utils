1 - Run Reslice2.ijm and save the smooth volume (can be improved)
	> Check which channels of .lsm files correspond to EDU and DAPI
	> Make sure there is no "." in .lsm files names
	> Check the images Preview-XXX to see whether ROI matches the resulting images
	> If hyperstack if inverted along z, uncomment the two lines run("Reverse");
	> If hyperstack if inverted along x, uncomment the two lines run("Flip Horizontally", "stack");

2 - Use gendisk.py in paraview to create 3D surface
	> Remove "-smooth" from disks file's name

3 - Use makeboxEctopic.py in Paraview to generate the box and move it to the right place. Next use makeboxEctopic2.py to save the fold as xx-Disk-Dec.vtk

4 - Run dapiSeg.cxx to get the files _Points.vtk

5 - Run proQuant.cxx with the flag -ectopic for Experiment and -ectopic -fixed_center for Control to get the files _results.txt
	> Run PolyDataReaderFix.py in Paraview if there is incompatible versions (4.2 vs. 4.0) between readers.

6 - Run TestEDU-DAPI-Ratio.ijm
	> Check which channels of .lsm files correspond to EDU and DAPI (1st EDU, 2nd DAPI)

7 - Use flatextension.py in paraview to calculate the area of the flat region.

8 - Run DistanceAnalyze.R
